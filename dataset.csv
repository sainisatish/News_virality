Sensing the imminent crisis, we approached our village headman but no help came through. I had no option but to borrow money from my co-villagers,” said Anrul Miyan.Lockdown extension added to the worries of Anrul Miyan. He approached the block officials in a hope to find any assistance.“Entertaining his request, we are looking forward to help him by providing food grains,” said Raghvendra Tripathi, block development officer (BDO), Narkatiganj."

It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement issued early on Tuesday.The statement came hours after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which plays a key role in advising authorities engaged in the fight against Covid-19, said state governments should stop using the rapid antibody testing kits from Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics after several states questioned the efficacy of the kits.Both Wondfo and Livzon, she said, had clarified that their testing kits had been certified by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), meet the quality standards China and importing countries, and had also been validated and approved by ICMR through the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.“The Covid-19 antibody rapid test kits produced by these two Chinese companies have been exported to and well recognised in many countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America,” she added.Ji further said Beijing hopes New Delhi “could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, strengthen communication timely with relevant Chinese companies based on facts, and resolve [the matter] reasonably and properly”.She said there are strict requirements for the storage, transportation and use of rapid antibody testing kits. “Any operation which is not carried out by professionals in accordance with the product specifications will lead to the testing accuracy variations,” she said.Ji described viruses as a common enemy of mankind and said China will continue to support India’s efforts in fighting Covid-19, strengthen medical and health cooperation, and jointly work to overcome difficulties to safeguard the safety of people in both countries.India has placed orders for hundreds of thousands of testing kits and millions of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits with Chinese firms. However, several state governments reported wide variations in the results produced by kits from Wondfo and Livzon.The ICMR stressed in a statement issued on Monday that rapid antibody testing kits should be used only for surveillance, and said it had evaluated the kits from Wondfo and Livzon in field conditions.“The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes,” the statement said.“In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits procured from the above-mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers,” the statement added.A separate Indian government statement said orders from the two Chinese firms had been cancelled as their kits were “under-performing”. This statement added that ICMR had not made any payments so far for the supplies and the government wouldn’t incur any losses from the cancellation of the orders.Wondfo reacted to ICMR’s decision by it was “surprised and disappointed” as its “SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Lateral Flow Method) is one of the first tests to receive an import licence from India, and has been validated and approved by ICMR through National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune”.“We are currently investigating the ICMR’s concerns with our products and will share more information when it becomes available,” Wondfo said in a statement."

As a sign of gratitude, the first prayers at both Kedarnath and Badrinath shrine will be offered on his behalf for helping boost the local economy of the hills by his visits to the shrines,” Maharaj said.The minister further added that he would be going to Delhi after the lockdown is lifted to give the offerings from the prayers, holy flowers and holy water, to the Prime Minister.After the first prayers were offered at the Gangotri shrine on Sunday on behalf of PM Modi, the priests will now send holy Ganga water for the prime minister through the post, as a blessing to strengthen the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.PM Modi has donated Rs 1100 to Sripanch Mandir Samiti Gangotri on the auspicious occasion of Tritiya Mahaparva. Suresh Semwal, president of the Gangotri Dham Temple Committee, said that the sub-divisional magistrate of Bhatwadi area, Devendra Singh Negi gave the amount sent by Prime Minister Modi to the temple committee.“After that, we offered the first prayers to Goddess Ganga on behalf of the prime minister to give us the strength to fight the pandemic and win the war against coronavirus,” said Semwal.Deepak Semwal, secretary of Gangotri Dham Temple Committee said that anyone who offers prayers to Goddess Ganga is “given the holy water of Maa Ganga by the priests of the temple, which is why we are sending it to Prime Minister Modi also, as he offered prayers on Sunday.”Last year, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat gave credit to PM Modi’s frequent visits to the state as the reason behind the record influx of pilgrims to the four holy shrines of the state.In November, Rawat had tweeted, “This year, more than 34 lakh 81 thousand devotees have visited Chardham and Hemkund Sahib. Prime Minister Modi after visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines gave the message of clean and safe Chardham Yatra to all devotees, which brought a large number of pilgrims here.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Rudra meditation cave in Kedarnath in May last year. PM Modi spent a day meditating at the Rudra Caves, nearly a kilometer from the Kedarnath shrine. Following his visit, the cave received a significant number of bookings from across the country. He also visited the Badrinath shrine in May last year."

16,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unusually-cool-and-wet-april-takes-weather-office-by-surprise/story-1M7hswjWupRf4sf3p1HPmL.html,Unusually cool and wet April takes weather office by surprise,"  It is the end of April but it is unusually pleasant in Delhi. The maximum temperature has touched 40 degrees C here only once compared to eight days by this time last year. Even in other parts of the country, maximum temperatures are mostly below normal or normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). No heat waves have been recorded so far except in isolated pockets of Gujarat and Marathwada (and only for a day in both), which is unusual for this time of the year.IMD scientists are also surprised by intermittent wet spells that have kept maximum temperatures down when the rest of the world is recording above normal temperatures. In northwest India, this pattern is linked to back-to-back active western disturbances (WDs), which are not supposed to be around in April. By this time, these disturbances which start as low-pressure systems in the Mediterranean weaken and move to northern latitudes. Scientists said such changes may be due to weather anomalies in Europe. They could also be linked to favourable sea temperatures over the Pacific.The WDs brought a lot of rain to northwest India; there is also moisture incursion in east and northeast India from the Bay of Bengal, which has been bringing good rains in the pre-monsoon season. According to  IMD’s rainfall data, between March 1 and April 26, 13 states have recorded “large excess” of rains (60% above normal).“Our models show that  wind patterns will not support the development of heat waves till the end of the first week of May. There has been a lot of rain in the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains region. Rains will not subside immediately. There will be another strong wet spell in northwest India from May 4 to 6. We have not recorded any heat waves yet, except in isolated patches for a day,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.In Delhi and the National Capital Region, the below normal temperature has meant pleasant days and mildly cool nights. The maximum temperature on Saturday in Delhi was 7 degrees C below normal and minimum 5 degrees C below normal. “We had six WDs in March and six in April. Not all WDs brought rain but it has been mostly cloudy and winds are good which doesn’t allow maximum temperature to spike. In 2013 and 2014, we  saw similar weather in April,” explained Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre.“In April or May, the intensity of WDs reduce. There could be many reasons for this unusual pattern of active WDs this year. It could be linked to European climate anomalies,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, agreed with Rajeevan, saying: “WDs are low pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region, propagate eastward with the help of the fast moving winds in the upper atmosphere — the westerly jet. This year we had a larger than usual number of WDs active over India. However, these short-lived WDs may not be the only factor that is regulating the temperatures. The ocean temperatures over the Pacific are also favourable since El Niño conditions have not developed. Usually if El Niño conditions (anomalously warm ocean temperatures) are present in the central-east Pacific, it can drive heat waves over India during April-May months. It seems that both these factors have been favourable for below normal temperatures over north India.”While this could mean bearable weather in cities, continuous unseasonal rains in other parts of the country have led to crop damage. “We haven’t seen any heat waves yet except 40+ temperatures in some isolated pockets. Temperature has been below normal to normal in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-NCR, North Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh. There has been a lot of rain in the second half of April. Because of intense rains it has become cooler. Another WD is expected to affect northwestern India on April 30, which will again bring rain. Usually by April, WDs travel in upper latitudes. There is a lot of moisture incursion also. For the last two days, there has been a trough (region of low pressure) from Vidarbha to interior Tamil Nadu,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.India in March recorded a mean temperature of 24.92 degrees C ( 0.29 below normal), a maximum average of 31.08 degrees C (0.769 degree C below normal) and an average minimum temperature of 18.75 degree C ( 0.2 degree C below normal), according to  IMD."
17,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-tells-states-not-to-deploy-rapid-kits-of-china-firms/story-xQOrN2o5izTXovMWuIX6sI.html,ICMR tells states not to deploy rapid kits of China firms,"  Six days after it decided to evaluate rapid test kits (RTKs) used to test for Covid-19 antibodies after states reported huge variations in results, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday asked all states to which it sent the kits, sourced from China, to return them  — a move that comes even as one of the companies that supplied the kits revised prices sharply down following the Delhi high court’s observation on Sunday that there appeared to be significant profiteering going on. “ICMR evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics in field conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes. In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits procured from the above mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers,” said ICMR’s fresh advisory on rapid test kits issued on Monday.Sensitivity is the ability of the test to identify a so-called true-positive -- it gives a positive result when someone is infected. On April 16, the first batch of 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits arrived in Delhi from China, after missing two deadlines. The kits were part of ICMR’s plans and those of several states to aggressively expand testing. Of these, 300,000 were from Guangzhou Wondfo, and  250,000 from Zhuhai Livzon. They were dispatched to the states over the following few days. But with states reporting variations between6% and 71% in sensitivity, ICMR, onApril 21, asked for the kits to not be used for two days. “Since performance of these kits has been different in field settings from what the companies had submitted, these kits will be returned, and no money shall be paid. Rapid tests anyway have a limited role to play; the gold standard for identifying infection remains the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, said on Monday. Meanwhile, importers of  the RTKs  have begun selling at revised rates after the Delhi high court capped the price of a test kit at ₹400 on Sunday. The court had observed there was heavy profiteering in the import and distribution of Covid-19 rapid testing kits with a kit costing ₹245 being sold for as high as ₹600.Suresh K, proprietor, Matrix Labs, an importer of the Guangzhou Wondfo rapid test kits, said: “We have started selling the kits at ₹400 plus GST per unit. Whoever places an order will be given kits at this price from now on.”ICMR’s response on overpricing was that the price approved was based on the tender quotations received.“Price range approved by ICMR is ₹740-1,150 for RT-PCR, and ₹528-795 for rapid test. Any Indian company wanting to supply at lower rates is welcome to contact ICMR…,” the body said  in an official statement. It added that “…this was the first ever effort by any Indian agency to procure such kits and the rate quoted by the bidders was the only reference point.” ICMR spokesperson Dr Rajnikant Srivastava said: “ICMR bought kits on pre-decided rates based on the tender quotation; now ICMR can’t keep a tab on who gets it for how much and how much profit or loss the companies are making. ICMR is not in the picture here.”“These kits are not for early diagnosis as for that RT-PCR test is the gold standard; it can only be used for surveillance purposes, to periodically spot disease trends. To collect data on whether there is an old infection in a section of population or it is a recent infection; whether the spread is increasing or being successfully contained in places that are termed as hot spots, etc,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, in the briefing before deploying kits in the field. Suresh however, refused to admit that the kits have problems. “The kit is not faulty. It was made very clear from the start that these rapid kits are not meant to do confirmatory tests to detect infection. The states have got it all wrong,” he said.To be sure, researchers in the US too have found issues with first generation antibody test kits for Covid-19. "
18,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-focus-on-economy-in-battle-against-covid-pm/story-zwPL7jySKD14nXmejffw2K.html,Need to focus on economy in battle against Covid: PM Modi," Suggesting that India will need to focus on a two-pronged approach — preserving public health and reviving economic activity — Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday  placed particular emphasis on green zones (which include districts and regions which are free of the coronavirus disease) as the hub of future activity and a model to be aspired for.This is widely being interpreted as a sign that after May 3, the lockdown will continue in red zones — which are home to clusters of cases — while there can be further relaxations in the less affected zones. In an interaction with chief ministers on the pandemic on Monday — the fourth such meeting on the subject in just over a month — the PM emphasised the need for continued adherence to social distancing norms; spoke out against stigmatising people with the disease; told states that a high number of cases is not a matter to be ashamed about or fear, but to be dealt with through concerted action; and called for an intensive study of the situation in each district and zone to then assess the kind of activities which can be permitted without the disease spreading. In the meeting, most state chief ministers called for a continued lockdown in the red zones while easing restrictions in non-Covid districts. They also demanded a clearer protocol on the return of migrant workers, and asked the Centre for comprehensive financial support given the plummeting revenues and fragile fiscal situation in states. A participant at the meeting, directly quoting the PM, said, “He emphasised that on the one hand, we are challenged by how to save lives and on the other, we also have to equally focus on the financial aspect. Focusing on one more than the other is not possible. That’s why, the PM underlined, we have to strengthen economic activities and increase our strength to combat the virus.” To implement this formulation in practice, the PM said that each state must study the impact of the lockdown in red zones, orange zones and green zones, where a range of activities have been permitted since April 20, and carefully consider where it is possible to lift restrictions, allow private transport, permit the elderly to move, and resume more economic activity without the disease spreading. The meeting participant said, “The PM emphasised that there must be extra caution in red zones and hotspots, which are high-risk, with special teams assigned for them. The objective is to ensure that the infection does not move beyond the red zones and safe regions remain safe.” In this backdrop, the PM called the green zones sacred, and emphasised that while practising social distancing, these regions will contribute to economic activity. “The 300 districts which are safe/ green zones , I believe, should be treated as sacred, like our tirthsthans (pilgrimage sites). Our focus will be how to expand the green zone. How our life will be in the coming days will be determined by the model in the green zone, not in the orange and definitely not the red zone.” It will also help ensure, the PM said, according to the participant quoted above, that the lockdown stayed — but life continued as well. “The mantra he gave to states was to convert red zones to orange, and orange to green zones.” According to a government assessment in mid-April, 170 districts in 20 states and five Union Territories (UTs) were identified as red zones. Additionally, there were 207 orange zones in the country, and the rest of India’s 730-odd districts were classified as green zones. A district is considered a red zone if it has large outbreaks, multiple clusters or if the infection doubling rate is less than four days. If such an area does not report any new case for 14 days, it turns into an orange zone. With no cases for another 14 days, the region is then classified as green, or Covid-free.   Commenting on the balancing act between health and the economy, Suyash Rai of Carnegie India said, “India has now ramped up testing and got beds ready. But eventually, to fight Covid-19, you need revenue. Or fiscal resources will dry up this year. So economic activity has to start carefully with all precautions in place.”The PM also repeatedly invoked a phrase he first used in a meeting with gram panchayat heads — of the need to maintain do gaj doori, or a distance of two yards. He spoke, for the second time after his Mann ki Baat address on Sunday, on the indispensability of masks. The PM also said it was important not to treat those who had tested positive as criminals, while remaining vigilant. To states, he said, “I want to, with all humility, say to all the CMs that if there are a spurt of cases, then your state won’t be seen as guilty. If cases are low in your state, it won’t be seen as great. We don’t want this sentiment. We will just try to tackle it. If numbers increase in your state, don’t be scared.” Nine chief ministers spoke at the meeting — while some others gave their inputs in writing due to constraints of time. They provided an appraisal of the situation in their respective states, while making specific demands from the Centre. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said it would not be possible to bring migrants back home unless the Centre issued clear directives in this regard. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik asked for enhanced testing facilities, and a screening of migrant workers for the disease before they were sent home. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, in a communiqué to the Centre, asked for opening of all small shops, businesses and industries in all areas except the containment zones. Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar asked the Central government to provide clarity on the schedules of various entrance examinations for medical and engineering college as well as for the armed forces, in the backdrop of the disruption in the academic calendar. He also provided details on the economic activities that have been resumed in the state. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal did not speak at the meeting, but a senior state government official said that the decision on the lockdown will be taken later in the week — in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the Centre. Kerala, which was represented by chief secretary Tom Jose in the meeting, has sought staggered removal of the lockdown and an exclusive Covid financial package. Kerala has also asked the Centre to expedite return of 1.8 million migrants from the state, currently in West Asian countries. Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren has sought relaxation on the ban on inter-state travel so that arrangements could be made to bring back students and migrant workers stuck in other states. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma of Meghalaya said he proposed extension of lockdown. “We have mooted to continue with the lockdown post May 3rd with relaxation on activities in green zones or non-Covid affected districts in Meghalaya,” Sangma tweeted after the meeting. Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga said that the only Covid patient in the state was recovering slowly. “Since we are surrounded by Myanmar, Bangladesh and neighbouring states, which also have Covid-19 patients, we can’t be complacent,” he said, adding that the state will relax the lockdown slightly after May 3 and allow some economic activity slowly. Another key issue in the intervention of states was that of finances. Five opposition ruled states — Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, West Bengal and a Rajasthan — have sought close to ₹2.25 lakh crore from the Centre to overcome stress on the state finances due to the national lockdown. This is in addition to demand of the state governments asking the Centre to pay the pending Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation immediately, increase the borrowing limit from 3% of the state GDP to 5%, suspend repayment of all state development loans for a period of three months and allow flexi funds under Centrally sponsored schemes for Covid management. Former chief statistician of India, Pronab Sen, said the Centre will have to strike a balance between the financial needs of the states and the central government departments. “There may be a need to re-look at the way the money is shared between the Centre and the states. The Reserve Bank of India has taken several steps to help the states but more could be needed if the lockdown continues for long. It is not time to worry about fiscal slippages and we should relax the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management norms to reduce human suffering,” he said."

It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement issued early on Tuesday.The statement came hours after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which plays a key role in advising authorities engaged in the fight against Covid-19, said state governments should stop using the rapid antibody testing kits from Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics after several states questioned the efficacy of the kits.Both Wondfo and Livzon, she said, had clarified that their testing kits had been certified by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), meet the quality standards China and importing countries, and had also been validated and approved by ICMR through the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.“The Covid-19 antibody rapid test kits produced by these two Chinese companies have been exported to and well recognised in many countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America,” she added.Ji further said Beijing hopes New Delhi “could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, strengthen communication timely with relevant Chinese companies based on facts, and resolve [the matter] reasonably and properly”.She said there are strict requirements for the storage, transportation and use of rapid antibody testing kits. “Any operation which is not carried out by professionals in accordance with the product specifications will lead to the testing accuracy variations,” she said.Ji described viruses as a common enemy of mankind and said China will continue to support India’s efforts in fighting Covid-19, strengthen medical and health cooperation, and jointly work to overcome difficulties to safeguard the safety of people in both countries.India has placed orders for hundreds of thousands of testing kits and millions of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits with Chinese firms. However, several state governments reported wide variations in the results produced by kits from Wondfo and Livzon.The ICMR stressed in a statement issued on Monday that rapid antibody testing kits should be used only for surveillance, and said it had evaluated the kits from Wondfo and Livzon in field conditions.“The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes,” the statement said.“In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits procured from the above-mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers,” the statement added.A separate Indian government statement said orders from the two Chinese firms had been cancelled as their kits were “under-performing”. This statement added that ICMR had not made any payments so far for the supplies and the government wouldn’t incur any losses from the cancellation of the orders.Wondfo reacted to ICMR’s decision by it was “surprised and disappointed” as its “SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Lateral Flow Method) is one of the first tests to receive an import licence from India, and has been validated and approved by ICMR through National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune”.“We are currently investigating the ICMR’s concerns with our products and will share more information when it becomes available,” Wondfo said in a statement."

The Covid-19 pandemic has, however, forced an indefinite postponement of the T20 tournament. Chopra has still found a way to keep his passion and profession of calling on cricket going, by joining digital cricket franchise World Cricket Championship (WCC).The former India Test opener has thus become the first professional commentator to call on digital cricket matches of the WCC 3, which has a huge fan base of 110 million users.It will be an interesting switch from commentating on the biggest players in the world to talking about the action played out in the digital space, one which will require some adjustment.“It does challenge you in a very different way, where your primary motive is to make it as real as possible. The challenge is to constantly increase your vocabulary, find a way to describe the same thing in 5-7 different ways,” says Chopra.A batsman hitting six on each delivery of an over may be extremely rare in professional cricket, but it is of common occurrence in digital games. For Chopra, being versatile and creative on such instances is the real challenge.“Unlike in real cricket where there are passages of play, (such as) wherein not all the time all six balls of an over are being hit for a six—here is a possibility of that (happening). If you recall that Stuart Broad over (against Yuvraj Singh in 2007 World T20), that is a real challenge for a commentator—find a different way to describe the same outcome, if not the shot,” Chopra said.“When you are doing commentary, you are there (on the mic) for only half-an-hour with two of your colleagues, you get up to eight overs of play, out of which 10 minutes of talking time. But this is on your own—you are the only one guiding the whole narrative through the entire game.”"

During a podcast with cricketer-turned-commentator Sanjay Manjrekar for ‘ESPNCricinfo’, Ashwin spoke about how the 2010 IPL with the Chennai Super Kings affected him, the challenges of bowling in hostile conditions of Australia and England, and why spin twin Ravindra Jadeja is a “natural athlete”. Ashwin recalled the 2010 IPL when he was dropped from the CSK squad after two bad games, which was like a “hard slap”, more so because he felt that coach Stephen Fleming “didn’t talk to him” and he was not backed enough. “People thought that I think highly of myself but flattening of the curve happened when I played in the IPL. It was like a slap in the face like ‘listen boss you are not even here’. “I thought bowling in a T20 game was much easier than bowling in a first-class game,” Ashwin recalled. It was a game against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bengaluru where Robin Uthappa and Mark Boucher took him to the cleaners. “Robin Uthappa and Mark Boucher taught me harsh lessons as I bowled 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th over at RCB. That youth in me never told me that it was a challenge. I found it as an opportunity to pick wickets.    “I didn’t get wickets but went for 40 or 45 runs and put my team into a hole as the next game went into Super Over and we lost it and I was dropped from the squad. It felt like a hard slap,” the Tamil Nadu tweaker said. Those were the days when IPL franchises, during home games, would release players who are not in first 18 in order to save hotel cost. Ashwin was back home watching CSK games on TV. “I was dropped, I vacated the hotel and was sitting at home. I thought that I deserved better as I was in the 30 probables for the 2010 World T20 in West Indies (he didnt make it on that tour),” he said.   “Like I thought, why didn’t you back me (CSK). I did exceedingly well in first three games and I had just had two bad games. Anybody can be hit for a couple of games.”   He admitted having issues with Fleming who, he thought, had let him down. “Actually, I had an issue with Stephen Fleming that he didn’t have a chat. I valued him so much and he didn’t have a chat. So I was sitting at home watching CSK games and making promises in my head that one day I will turn the tide,” Ashwin said. He has come a long way since then. The 33-year-old Ashwin has picked 365 wickets from 71 Tests, but his performance in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) hasn’t matched the lofty standards that he has set at home. “Increasingly, the number of games I’ve played in England, I’ve started realising that for a spinner to be bowling in alien conditions and to be able to repeat similar numbers (as at home), you need to be bowling in all the possible right times of the game, first,” Ashwin said.    “And, secondly, you do need a little bit of luck. After 2014 (December 2013) when I had that South Africa game, I’ve taken a very serious look at my numbers and those numbers have significantly increased very, very well.”   “For me to able to deliver on a consistent basis abroad there are a lot of factors beyond just me that need to go into it.”   "

On the occasion of her 33rd birthday, we take a look at five films from her illustrious career.One of the earliest films of her career, Ye Maya Chesave gave a glimpse of Samantha’s potential in a very unorthodox role of a mainstream heroine stripped bare of the glitz and glamour. The film, which was a runaway hit, marked the maiden collaboration of Samantha and her future husband Akkineni Naga Chaitanya. The film follows the story of a young Mechanical Engineer Karthik, who aspires to become a film director and falls in love with Jessie, who is older than him. Jessie will remain as one of the most iconic roles in Samantha’s career even today because she played it so early on in her career with barely any experience. One can only imagine how challenging it would’ve been to pull off. If you’re under the assumption that heroines don’t have much to do in SS Rajamouli’s films, you have to watch Eega to realize how much scope the film offers Samantha to perform and shine. In a role that sees her take revenge for the murder of her boyfriend, who returns to life in the form of a housefly; the film saw Samantha bring out the vulnerability of her character very effectively. If we are talking about one of her underrated performances, her role in Eega definitely deserves a mention.Even though a remake of a Kannada film, I’d personally rate U-Turn as one of Samantha’s best performances. It’s special because it truly unleashed a never seen before kind of performance from Samantha, who was seen playing a crime journalist whose life turns upside down after she volunteers to find the reason behind the mysterious deaths of motorists on a flyover. The film allowed Samantha to own a film completely on her shoulders and she succeeding in the attempt by delivering a knockout performance.Super Deluxe is Tamil cinema’s most eccentric and boldest attempts in recent years. What’s interesting is that the film saw Samantha take up her boldest role yet. She played a wife who ends up in an awkward situation when the man she’s having an affair with ends up dead while in the act. It’s not easy for a mainstream heroine to play something so bold, especially when the film happens to be her first release after marriage. Built on the premise of morality, the film questions what is right and what’s wrong and in the process, makes us understand that what’s right for someone need not be necessarily wrong for others. It’s also a terrific social commentary on life, sex, gender, science, religion, spirituality, marriage and faith.Samantha’s Oh Baby, a remake of South Korean comedy Miss Granny, is based on a very simple premise - what if we got a second chance to relive life and change everything we couldn’t the first time? This is Samantha’s maiden attempt at a full-length comedy and it works so well thanks to the energy she brings to her character. It’s extremely challenging to play a 20-something character but adopt the body language of a 69-year-old and Samantha nails the dichotomy with ease, bringing so much exuberance to her performance and she couldn’t have played it any better. If not for Samantha’s really refreshing performance, Oh Baby wouldn’t have made so much difference. "

Watch," Lions are considered to have great strength and fierce precision. Well, these two lion bros who are just hanging out and falling atop each other showcase the  softer side of the king-of-the-jungle. This 15-second-long clip was posted to Reddit on April 27. Sarcastically captioned, “Showdown between two fierce apex predators”; it has been appropriately shared on the subreddit ‘aww’. The recording starts with one lion walking towards the other who is sitting on the grass. The first lion does an action with his body which looks a whole lot like the one-arm embrace humans do. After the hug is over the second lion gets up from his spot and goes to possibly spoon with the first one, who is now lying on the ground. The derpy lions cannot seem to catch a break though because as soon as the second lion falls atop the other one, he rolls away. The lions lie back-to-back next to each other for a quick second after which they give up any attempts for potential cuddles.Here is how Redditors reacted to this goofy pair! One individual on the thread wrote, “Finish him! With snuggles”. While another said, “Cats is cats”. To which another responded with, “Bros being bros”. A Reddit user tried to guess the two lions’ perspective when writing, “Lion 1: Come on! Come on! Lie on me! Lion 2: proceeds to lie Lion 1: haha PSYCHE”. “They’re just lion around,” read a comment punnily. To which another replied, “Puns are manely why I come here”."

But there are many people who are not maintaining this. So, I thought to spread the message of importance of social distancing among people. Accordingly, I modified a motorbike that runs on petrol by using bicycle sets as front and back seats keeping one meter distance from each other.And instead of petrol engine, I used a DC motor of 750 Watt, a battery of 48 volt to convert it as an electric motorbike. And this motorbike is meant for spreading the message but not to serve commercial purpose,” said Partha Saha.This bike which he designed this April, would take 3 hours to get charged and with the single charge, it could run around 80 kilometres.He also expressed that while designing the motorbike, he once had thought to use it to drop his nine-year old daughter to school post lockdown. Later, he discarded the idea as taking permission from Transport Department to ply this vehicle on road would consume much time.His YouTube channel ‘Technical Partha’ has more than three lakh subscribers. “Someone made a video of my motorbike and posted it on social media. Perhaps, the video will attract many people. I appeal people to maintain social distance,” he said."

This cat and seagull duo are showing everyone how to have a good catch-up with your mates while following social distancing customs.This almost 30-second-long video was posted to Reddit on April 25. Titled, “Seagull updates cat on latest gossip”; it focuses on a dialogue between two individuals from these respective species. Even though each is talking in its own language, with the cat ‘meowing’ and the seagull ‘squawking’, the conversation seems to be flowing flawlessly. The best part of the video is that the feline is seen sitting on a shelf behind a closed window indoors whilst the bird is standing outside on the windowsill.It is truly refreshing to see such an unlikely friendship! This pair drives home the point that similarity is not the only ground to establish fruitful relationships on. Sometimes all you need is a little extra effort from both the parties to meet halfway in their understanding of each other.Here is how Redditors reacted to the recording! One person said, “It’s like Nigel coming to talk to the fish at the dentist office”, referencing the animation classic ‘Finding Nemo’.Another Reddit user tried to guess the exchange between two animals when writing, “Cat: ‘No way!’ Seagull: ‘I know right?’ Cat: ‘She SAID that??’ Seagull: ‘I KNOW, right??’”"

It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement issued early on Tuesday.The statement came hours after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which plays a key role in advising authorities engaged in the fight against Covid-19, said state governments should stop using the rapid antibody testing kits from Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics after several states questioned the efficacy of the kits.Both Wondfo and Livzon, she said, had clarified that their testing kits had been certified by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), meet the quality standards China and importing countries, and had also been validated and approved by ICMR through the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.“The Covid-19 antibody rapid test kits produced by these two Chinese companies have been exported to and well recognised in many countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America,” she added.Ji further said Beijing hopes New Delhi “could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, strengthen communication timely with relevant Chinese companies based on facts, and resolve [the matter] reasonably and properly”.She said there are strict requirements for the storage, transportation and use of rapid antibody testing kits. “Any operation which is not carried out by professionals in accordance with the product specifications will lead to the testing accuracy variations,” she said.Ji described viruses as a common enemy of mankind and said China will continue to support India’s efforts in fighting Covid-19, strengthen medical and health cooperation, and jointly work to overcome difficulties to safeguard the safety of people in both countries.India has placed orders for hundreds of thousands of testing kits and millions of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits with Chinese firms. However, several state governments reported wide variations in the results produced by kits from Wondfo and Livzon.The ICMR stressed in a statement issued on Monday that rapid antibody testing kits should be used only for surveillance, and said it had evaluated the kits from Wondfo and Livzon in field conditions.“The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes,” the statement said.“In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits procured from the above-mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers,” the statement added.A separate Indian government statement said orders from the two Chinese firms had been cancelled as their kits were “under-performing”. This statement added that ICMR had not made any payments so far for the supplies and the government wouldn’t incur any losses from the cancellation of the orders.Wondfo reacted to ICMR’s decision by it was “surprised and disappointed” as its “SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Lateral Flow Method) is one of the first tests to receive an import licence from India, and has been validated and approved by ICMR through National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune”.“We are currently investigating the ICMR’s concerns with our products and will share more information when it becomes available,” Wondfo said in a statement."

Shyam Sundar, Professor at Pennsylvania State University in the US.“The mere presence of privacy settings seems to trigger thoughts of potential privacy problems among those who are aware of such loopholes in communication technologies,” he said.“Once you give power users these options and they realise (that privacy settings are) actually controllable, they tend to panic and see the between-the-lines message rather than see customisation for what it is, which is really a benevolent effort to provide more user control,” he added.Another major finding showed that users who were sensitive about their privacy found content less credible when given the option to customise their privacy settings.However, trust in the content increased when these users were also given the opportunity to customise that content.ALSO READ: ICICI Bank launches voice banking service on Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant: How to use itIn the first part of the study, half of the users were randomly given the opportunity to customize their privacy settings -- such as deleting their voice recordings -- while the others were not.Then, another random half of the sample was able to customise their content-- such as adjusting speed or content length, or selecting the source of information -- while the other half was not afforded the opportunity.The findings were published in the proceedings of 2020 ACM Conference on Human Factors and Computing Systems (CHI) which was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic."

He was quoted as saying, “I have not spoken to her after Mujhse Shaadi Karoge. I don’t want to speak with Shehnaz. I am over and done with her kyunki aap usko thodi der jhel sakte ho (you can tolerate her only for a brief period of time) not more than that.

However, Suresh Raina believes Pant is a match-winner and should be backed by the management as can be as dominant as Yuvraj Singh or Virender Sehwag.“He is a top cricketer, when he plays well, you become happy and he reminds of Yuvraj and Sehwag, he is as dominant as them, when he plays the flick, it reminds you of Dravid as well,” Raina told Chahal during the Instagram Live session.Raina also heaped praise on captain Virat Kohli and said that the energy he brought out on to the field is a game-changer when he leads the side in the shorter formats. “Virat is a solid captain, he has a lot of energy, he can control things, when you are playing shorter formats, you need a lot of energy and passion,” he added.Rohit Sharma had earlier said that Pant gets a lot of media scrutiny despite the fact that he is pretty young in his career and this has all built up a lot of pressure on the left-hander. “I talk to Rishbh Pant more, he is just 20-21, he was under so much of scrutiny that he got tensed.”“Media thinks its part of their job to write but they should be sensible and think before writing something as it plays a huge part,” Rohit Sharma said."

While the makers of Ranveer Singh-starrer 83 have confirmed the film won’t release online, filmmaker Shoojit Sircar is keeping his options open for his upcoming film Gulabo Sitabo. The quirky comedy stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Amitabh Bachchan in lead roles  and was scheduled to hit theatres on April 17. Sharing his plans for the film’s release, director Shoojit told Mumbai Mirror in an interview, “As a filmmaker, I’d want to see my film open in the theatres, but the situation today is unlike anything anyone had ever experienced. So, I’m open to a digital release if need be, but we will take a decision after May 3.” The second lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in place till May 3. He, however, made it clear that his another project, Sardar Udham Singh biopic, starring Vicky Kaushal, deserves to release on the silver screen. The shooting of the film is complete but it is still in the post-production stage. “Since it is scheduled for January 2021, we are not thinking about it right now. I’d like a film like this to be a big screen experience. I have lived with this dream for so long that when we were shooting at Jallianwala Bagh, I had tears in my eyes,” he said.           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Shoojit Sircar (@shoojitsircar) on Dec 26, 2019 at 11:45pm PST Shoojit also said post lockdown, people “will invest in a bigger and better TV or a home theatre” which will require cost correction in film budgets and a cap on the price of film tickets.
